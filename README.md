# PlanCanicule1030
The  "plan canicule communal" in Schaerbeek is a proactive approach aimed at protecting residents, particularly the most vulnerable, during periods of extreme heat.
It includes prevention, information, and assistance measures,
with a particular focus on people who are isolated or in precarious situations.

### Registration of vulnerable people:
It is possible to register to benefit from regular telephone support during periods of extreme heat.

### Home visits:
Teams can visit the homes of registered individuals to ensure their well-being and provide advice.

### Identification of cool spots:
Mapping of cool spots and reminders of water points and public fountains.

### Emergency management:
In case of heat-related symptoms, it is recommended to contact your doctor or call 112.

### Call-free number:
A dedicated number (0800 35 446) allows you to report anyone who is isolated or may need help during a heatwave.
